Upon   successful   completion   of   this   module, you   will:
•          Critically    analyse   and   investigate   a   relevant   research   problem   demonstrating   a   systematic   understanding of   knowledge and a critical awareness of   current issues in international   business   management   and   an   advanced   critical   understanding   of   the   pertinent   theories.
•          Demonstrate      appropriate      knowledge      and      understanding      of      research      methodology,      data collection methods, and data analysis techniques   to create   and   interpret knowledge.
•          Evidence    self-direction,   reflection,   and   originality   to   independently   design   an   appropriate   research   strategy   to   investigate   the   identified   problem,   manage   the   project   and   deliver   the   research output in the required format.
5               Table of   UnitsA list of   materials is   provided on the canvas   page. The materials   will   provide   you   with a comprehensive   understanding of   the importance of   the   research   process and its significance for developing an effective   project.   They   are   generally   underpinned   by   systematic   means   and   case   study   methods.   This   should   ensure   that   the   research   undertaken   is   logical,   coherent   and   replicable.   This   includes   addressing   research   philosophy,   induction/deduction   and   abduction   issues, research   approaches, methodological   choices,   research strategies, data collection and analysis methods   and presentation   of   research   findings.
You   are   expected   to   cover   the   fully   allocated   learning   materials   by   engaging   in   proactive   learning   outside      the      sessions,      such      as      undertaking      additional      reading      to      widen      your      knowledge      and   understanding of   the course material. You will be expected to demonstrate this in   your   final project.
The   Canvas   page   will   be   organized   as   of   the   following:
Unit   1
Professional Development and Key Academic Skills
Description:In    this    unit,    you    will      cover      a      range      of    academic      approaches      required      for   professional    skill   development.   You   will   evaluate    and   interpret   a   variety    of   sources to   formulate   and   support well-reasoned   arguments.   In the   sessions, you   will   use   logic,   reasoning,   critical   analysis,   and   reflection   to   prepare   you   for   research   inquiry.   You   will   define   ethics   in   business   research   and   discuss   why   ethics      is      important.    You      will      learn      about      research      participants,      participant information   forms,   consent   forms   and   how   to   gain   ethical   approval   for   your   project. You will also be introduced to common dilemmas in   ethics.

Literature Review
Description:This unit will   give you the   skills   to   develop   a   critical   awareness   of   your   chosen   topic. You will learn what a literature review is and how to search for appropriate   sources.   Using   the   session's   case   studies,   you   will   distinguish   the   differences   between descriptive and critical writing. In this session, you will create a plan   for   writing your literature review.

Unit 4
Research Philosophy
Description:You will begin to consider the nature of   reality and knowledge. This session will   introduce the terms ontology and epistemology, which will become important as   you   consider   your   methodology's   paradigmatic   position.   The   seminar   will   be   primarily focused on   positivism and interpretivism.   You   will   have   the   opportunity   to apply what you have learned to real-life research topics.

Unit   6      7
Qualitative Research   Part 12
Description:You   will   recognise   the   key   characteristics   of   key   qualitative   research   and   reflect on its strengths and weaknesses. You will be able   to   compare   various   qualitative   research strategies, including ethnography and   phenomenology. This session will   be      focused      on      collecting      data      via      interviews,      focus      groups,      and      visual   methodologies.    You      will      have      the      opportunity      to      analyse      transcripts      using   thematic analysis.

6             Assessment Information
You   will   be   required   to   submit   one   written   research   project   of   10,000   words   containing   an introduction,   literature review, methodology, presentation   of   results,   discussion,   and   conclusions.This is a summative assessment weighted at   100%. This will assess   all the module   learning   outcomes.   You are required to submit a copy of   your work on Canvas (a hard copy is not required). The deadline   date will be posted on   Canvas.
You must submit your report through Turnitin and include a   copy   of   the report with your   submission.   Your project should include a cover page detailing your full name   (not informal names   adopted   in
English), course, student number, project title, and module   number.
The last submission of   the   assignment   before   the submission date will   be deemed the final submission   for assessment purposes. All work submitted must adhere to the University Policy on   'Cheating,
Collusion, and Plagiarism'. Two staff   members assess each project   internally. A   sample   of   work   is   also sent to the Programme External   Examiner.
7             Project   Supervision
You will be allocated a   project supervisor. Your supervisor will support you through the project phase of   your studies. The scheduled dates for meeting your supervisor should be mutually   agreed   upon between you and your supervisor. You must explicitly agree with your supervisor   about how   the supervision will work for you. Meetings without   a specific section of   your work to discuss are   unlikely to be an effective use of   time. If   you have a   question or   a point to   check,   an   email   will be         more effective. Writing a good section of   material   and   submitting   it before your meeting means   the   supervisor will have read and commented upon it. It is also   a   sound idea   to   have   sometime   as   soon   as possible after a supervision session so you   can   followup   on   the   comments.   Successful   students         have also found it helpful at each supervision   session   to plan   out the next   stage   of   work   and   the target dates   for this.
